This folder contains the "source code" of the documentation, and it meant to be built with sphinx.
http://sphinx-doc.org

The following command executed from a cmd prompt in this directory:
make html

...should run the python script that generates the html documentation.

The result (in the build folder) should then be copied into the Help folder, so that it is copied to the same location when SCICompanion.exe is built.
