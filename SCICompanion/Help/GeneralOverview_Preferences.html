<h1>Editor preferences</h1>

<p>The preferences dialog allows you to manipulate various editor settings.
Most of these are explained in the relevant sections.  Those that are not, are detailed here.</p>
<p>To reset the preferences to the default (in case the current settings result in a problem that
prevents you from accessing the preferences dialog), hold down the SHIFT key while starting SCI Companion.
<h4>Drawing tools use grid lines</h4>
<p>If this is checked, the drawing tools in the pic editor will have grid lines extending
out in each direction.  This can be useful for lining up distant objects in a pic.</p>

<h4>Use auto-suggest</h4>
<p>Use auto-suggest (as opposed to auto-complete) in edit boxes that support it (such as
the Add As -> Synonym function of the script editor).</p>

<h4>Automatically load last game on open</h4>
<p>Open the last game when you start <b>SCI Companion</b></p>

<h4>Views: dupe new cels</h4>
This determines whether new cels in a view resource are copied from the previous cel, or
start off blank (filled with the transparent colour).

<h4>Open some SCI01 games</h4>
Though you can't create SCI1 or SCI01 games with <b>SCI Companion</b>,
 this will let you open and browse
the resources of games that have the SCI0 resource.map file format, but SCI1 compression
techniques.  Quest For Glory 2 is the only game I know of like this.

<h4>Script editor browse information</h4>
This is explained in more detail in <a href="Script_BrowseInfo.html">Script browsing information</a>
