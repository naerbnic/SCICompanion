<h1>Converting a bitmap to a pic</h1> 
<p>The convert bitmap to pic dialog will allow you to take a bitmap (or jpg, etc...) from
a file or the clipboard, and convert into vector commands to be added to your pic resource.</p>

<p><img src="images/ConvertBitmap.jpg"></p>

<h4>The conversion process</h4>
<ol> 

<li>Choose <b>Import bitmap to pic</b> from the <b>Pic</b> menu.
 This will open a dialog.  If an image is on the clipboard, it will appear on the left.  Otherwise,
open an image using the Browse button.

<li>Adjust the picture using the <b>Brightness</b>, <b>Contrast</b> and <b>Saturation</b> controls. 

<li>Click the <b>Convert</b> button.  A progress bar will animate as the conversion takes place,
and the resulting image will appear on the right.

<li>Check the image size - is it small enough to be a SCI0 pic resource?

<li>The options on the right control the conversion process - which colours are allowed, and
how many to use.  Selecting different options can have a big effect on picture size.

<li>Once you are satisfied with the result, click <b>Accept</b>.  The vector commands that make up
the image will be added to your pic

</li> 
</ol>
