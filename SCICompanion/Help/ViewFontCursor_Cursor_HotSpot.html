<h1>Setting the hot spot</h1> 

<p>To set the hot spot, use the <b>origin tool</b>  <img src="images/Placement.png"> , and click on a point near the top-left or
center of the cursor image. In SCI0, the hotspot can only be located in one of these
two locations.<p>
<b>Note:</b> The SCI0 interpreter always uses the top-left as the hotspot.  Setting it to the center using SCI Companion will have
no effect.
