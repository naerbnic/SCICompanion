<h1>Adding or removing cels and loops</h1> 
<h4>Adding a loop or cel</h4>
<p>In the left-hand pane, there are two buttons each for loops and cels:
<b>Add before</b> and <b>Add after</b>.  These will add a new loop or cel after or before
the currently selected one.
</p>
<p>By default, a newly added cel will be a copy of the currently selected one.  In the 
<b>Preferences</b> dialog, this can be changed so that instead, new cels will just be filled
with the current cel's transparent colour.<p>

<h4>Removing a cel</h4>
<p>Click on the cel in bottom pane, and press <b>DELETE</b></p>

<h4>Removing a loop</h4>
<p>By removing all cels in a loop, the loop will be removed.</p>
