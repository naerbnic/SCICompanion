<h1>An editor for SCI0 games</h1> 
<p><b>SCI Companion</b> will let you edit games you have created with
 <a href="http://www.bripro.com/scistudio">SCI Studio</a>.  It provides all of the
functionality of SCI Studio including new game creation.
 </p>

<li><a href="Compiler_Size.html">Smaller code generation</a> for compiled scripts
<li><a href="GeneralOverview_Browse.html">Thumbnail browsers</a> for pictures, fonts, cursors and views
<li><a href="Script_Vocab.html">Integration</a> of vocabulary file with script editor
<li>Better <a href="ScriptOverview.html">script editor</a> with tab indent support, and parenthesis highlighting
<li>Better keyboard support (hot keys that work)
<li>...and much more
</ul>

<p><b>SCI Companion</b> was designed for <b>Windows XP</b>.  It should also work on <b>Windows 2000</b>,
but is known to have problems on <b>Windows 98/ME</b>. Please contact me if you are using
Windows 98 or ME, and can't get it to work.
For all features to be functional, the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=gdi%2B+redistributable">GDI+ redistributable</a> must
be installed on the latter operating systems (it is included with XP).</p>
