<h1>Pic editor</h1> 
<p><img src="images/PicEditor.png"></p>

<p>The picture editor shows the pic itself in the main window, and the picture command list
on the right.  SCI pics consist of a series of vector drawing commands, and the editor
reflects that "limitation".  Bitmaps can be <a href="Pic_Convert.html">converted</a>
into vector drawings, but the process is inefficient, so you need to get used to
thinking like the editor.</p>

<p>Pics consist of three "screens".  The <b>visual screen</b>, which is what you see in the game,
 the <b>priority screen</b>, which controls which parts of the picture appear in front or 
behind the ego, and the <b>control</b> screen, which controls events that happen to characters in
the game.  You can view each of these screens by clicking on the appropriate button.</p>
