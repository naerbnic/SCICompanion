<h1>Script browsing information</h1> 
<p>Script browsing information can be turned on or off (along with its related settings) 
in the <a href="GeneralOverview_Preferences.html">Preferences dialog.</a>.  It is off by default.
<p>Script browsing is a powerful feature that analyzes the scripts and header files in your project, and will be able to provide
auto code completion, and contextual information about objects in your script.  This only works with home-made games, as it requires
the source code (*.sc) to work.  The browse information is compiled when you open the game.  The progress
can be seen in the status bar.  It will show you any errors.  Until these errors are corrected, browse information
may be incomplete and features which depend on it may not work.  To force SCICompanion to recompile the
browse information for a particular script after you fix erros, just save the script again.
<p>Script browsing may be taxing on your computer's CPU.  If typing is sluggish, turn it off (or just disable auto code completion).



<h4><strike>Auto code completion</strike> - currently disabled in this version</h4>
<p>As you type, SCI Companion will suggest words (methods, objects names, variable names, etc...) for completion. Hit
<b>Enter</b> to accept the suggestion, or the up and down arrow keys to choose another suggestion.</p>

<p>When you begin a method or procedure call, an infotip will appear with that method's signature.  The current parameter
will appear in bold.<p>

<h4>Going directly to the definition of an item</h4>
<p>If you right-click on an object, method call, variable, or defined value, the context menu will provide
an option to take you to the spot where this item is defined or declared (which may be in another script file, or header file).</p>

<p>

<h4><strike>Infotips</strike> - currently disabled in this version</h4>
When you hover over an item, a infotip will appear giving you more information.  For example, if you hover the cursor over
a method call, a infotip will appear with the method signature and the object on which it is defined.

<h4>Jump to a function</h4>
<p>At the top of the script editor is a combobox that lists all the functions and objects in the current
script file.  It displays the name of the function or object where the cursor is currently located.  You can
use this list to quickly jump to another function in the script.</p>

<p>

<h4>Quick links to views and pics</h4>
<p>At the top of the script toolbox are links to resources relevant to the current script.  Here you will
find the link to the pic resource (if this is a room), the views used in any Prop or Act instances, and links
to the scripts of any rooms to the north/east/south/west.  If the resource is already being edited, it will
switch you to that resource.  Otherwise, it will open the appropriate editor for that resource.</p>

<h4>When does browse information not work?</h4>
<p>
<b>Note: due to change in the architecture, infotips and auto code completion are no longer available.  The plan is to re-enable these features for the c++ syntax only in the future.</b>
<p>
You may notice auto code completion not working for newly created functions.  SCI Companion only updates its database
of objects and functions when the script
file when it is saved.  If you just added a procedure or object instance (e.g. a new Prop) to a script, you need to save
the script before it will appear in the code completion dropdown.
<p>
SCI Companion regenerates its browse database each time you load a game.  The first time you invoke the script editor
 for a game project, you may notice a short delay before things like code completion will work.  This is because SCI Companion is
scanning all the script and header files in your project, and building the database.  This should only take a few seconds (you
may notice your CPU in use).
<p>
SCI Companion may not recognize certain styles of code in the same manner as the script compiler does.  So it is possible
that code that compiles successfully will confuse SCI Companion.  If you think browse information is not working properly but should,
submit a bug report and include the offending SCI script (see the Help menu in SCI Companion).
