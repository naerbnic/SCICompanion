<h1>Coordinate light ups</h1> 
<p>By clicking on the <img src="images/LightUpCoords.png"> <b>Light up lines</b> button (or pressing <b>CTRL-L</b>), you can activate
a feature that "lights up" lines that appear before the current position in the picture,
and that are near the mouse cursor.  This serves two purposes.</p>

<h4>Matching lines on other screens</h4>
<p>If you happen to draw the control or priority lines at different times than the visual ones,
this will help you draw identical lines on other screens.</p>

<h4>Perfectly matching lines</h4>
<p>Often you want to outline a shape in a different colour.  By seeing exactly what lines
were drawn to make that shape, you can draw identical lines offset by just one pixel.
Then, the two colours will line up perfectly without gaps.

<p>The line direction (important) is indicated by the boxes (rear) and crosses (front).</p>
