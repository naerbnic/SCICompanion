<p><b>SCI Companion</b> uses a brand new compiler completely unrelated to Brian Provinciano's SCI compiler in SCI Studio.  
Currently only the SCIStudio-style syntax is supported (similar to LISP). The hopes are that this compiler will be able to 
easily support a c++ style language in the future, but this work is not yet complete.  The object files (*.sco) that are generated
are in the same format as those from SCIStudio, so you should still be able to use SCIStudio to compile your game scripts even
if you have compiled them in SCI Companion (i.e. they are compatible).
</p>

<h4>Stricter syntax checking</h4>
<p>
The SCI Companion compiler aims to provide stricter syntax checking and better error reporting, in order to help the user
find bugs in their code.  The SCIStudio language contains several syntactic ambiguities which make this difficult though.  Some
syntax which is supported by SCIStudio will not work in SCI Companion, so there may be some errors to fix.   Here is a list of what
must be fixed in the template game that is provided by SCIStudio (You will see these if you compile a game created in SCIStudio.  It is
safe to fix them.  The template game in SCI Companion has had these fixes applied already):
<ul>
<li><b>Gauge.sc, line 112:</b>  
<br>
<code>= ctlX (- (- nsRight (send btnCancel:nsRight) 4) )</code>
<br>
should change to
<br>
<code>= ctlX (- (- nsRight (send btnCancel:nsRight) ) 4)</code>

<li><b>SysWindow.sc, line 579:</b>  
<br>
<code>(procedure (IsSaveDialog)</code>
<br>
should change to
<br>
<code>(procedure (IsSaveDialog) of SRDialog</code>


<li><b>Jump.sc, line 62:</b>  
<br>
<code>= xStep ((send client:xStep) neg)</code>
<br>
should change to
<br>
<code>= xStep (neg (send client:xStep))</code>

</ul>

In addition, there are some warnings that show up.  These warnings don't result in bad code being generated, but
they should be fixed anyway.  It is only an "accident" of the compiler that this code does what is intended.
<ul>
<li><b>Controls.sc, line 387:</b>  
<br>
<code>(+ text (* x position))</code>
<br>
should change to
<br>
<code>return (+ text (* x position))</code>

<li><b>Cycle.sc, line 32:</b>  
<br>
<code>
(+ (send client:cel) cycleDir)
</code>
<br>
should be changed to 
<br>
<code>
return (+ (send client:cel) cycleDir)
</code>
</ul>
<p>
A common warning to see is 
<code>[Warning]: 'foo' has no effect on code</code>
This means that the code basically does nothing.  For example, if you had this statement by itself:
<code>(+ 5 4)</code>
That adds 5 and 4, but doesn't do anything with the result - therefore it serves no purpose.  SCI Companion can detect these
kinds of bugs.
