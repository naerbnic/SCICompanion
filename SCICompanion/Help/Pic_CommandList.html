<h1>The command list</h1> 
<p>On the right hand side of the picture editor is the command list.  It shows the
commands around the current position in the editor.  It can be used to move
to another position by clicking on a command.</p>

<h4>Deleting commands</h4>
 <p> Here you can
select multiple commands and delete them, or crop all commands after a particular point.
</p>

<h4>Copying and pasting commands</h4>
<p>More interestingly, you can also copy commands from here, and paste them into other pics
 - even in other running instances of <b>SCI Companion</b> - so you can copy and paste commands
from one game into another. </p>
<p> It takes some practise to select the correct set of commands
to copy.
Generally it is best to click on the command you want to start with, and then 
progressively scroll down
the list and use the SHIFT-click to find the end command.  Then click <b>Copy</b> at the
top of the command list.</p>
<p> When you paste a series of commands, they will be added
to the pic in a special mode that allows you to reposition them.  You may see 
strange behaviour as you move the drawing commands around the screen, but that is due
to the vector nature of the commands.</p>
