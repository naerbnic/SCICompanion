<h1>Editing multiple cels</h1> 
<p>View and font resources have multiple cels to work on.
  By selecting <b>Affect all cels in loop</b> or <b>Affect all characters</b> in the left-hand
pane, the drawing functions will operate on multiple cels at once.
</p>

<p>This functionality is very useful for quickly editing all cels in a view animations.  For
example, you can change the colour of a character's clothing for an entire animation with just a few clicks.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>The canvas background will turn red to remind you your actions are affecting all cels.
<li>Most drawing tools operate on a specific part of the image.  To calculate the appropriate
location of the other cels in a view loop, <b>SCI Companion</b> uses the offset properties of the 
cels.
</ul>
