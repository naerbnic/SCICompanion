<h1>Browsing and opening resources</h1>


<h4>Opening a game</h4>

<p>To open a game, choose <b>File->Open</b> and browse for the game's <b>resource.map</b> file.  When this
is opened, you'll be presented with a series of tabs for each resource type in the game.</p>

<p>Each tab lists all the resources of that type.  Views, pics, cursors and fonts show
thumbnails by default.  This can be changed to a list view that shows more information about
each resource.  The resources can be opened for editing, deleted, or exported to a file.</p>

<h4>Running the game</h4>
<p>Click the red running man icon <img src="images/RunGame.png">, press <b>F5</b>, or choose <b>Game->Run Game</b>.<p>

<h4>Resource management</h4>

<p>Whenever you edit and save a resource, it is added to the game without deleting the old one.
This lets you keep multiple old copies of a resource around.  While this may be useful, it
bloats the game file.  As in <b>SCI Studio</b>, you can rebuild resources <img src="images/Rebuild.png">, eliminating ones that
are no longer used.  You can also manually delete them.</p>

<p><b>SCI Companion</b> visually tags these unused items with "unused", so you can know which
ones are the most recent versions.  In addition, whenever a new resource is added, it is highlighted
in red to make it easier to find.</p>

<h4>Renaming resources</h4>

<p>You give a name to a resource (select it and press <b>F2</b>, or choose <b>Rename</b> from 
the <b>Edit</b> menu).  These names are not used by the game, but just
for convenience in editing.  They are stored in the game.ini file, and are used by <b>SCI Studio</b> too.</p>
