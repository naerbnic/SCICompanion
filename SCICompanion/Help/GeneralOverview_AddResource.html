<p>SCI Companion supports adding resources to your game, and extracting them from your game.</p>
<h4>Adding external resources to your game</h4>
<p>You can add a resource from external files by either browsing to them in a file dialog
(File->AddResource),
or by dropping them in from Windows Explorer.  In the latter case, the name of the file is
used to determine the resource number. </p>
<p> Resource files are named View.xxx, Pic.xxx, and so on,
where xxx is a three digit number.  They are the same files generated by and consumed
by SCI Studio, and used as patches by the SCI engine.</p>
<h4>Sample resources</h4>
Several sample resources are included.  They are available from the "toolbox" left-hand pane (and depend on which
resource type you are currently looking at in the game explorer).
<h4>Extracting resources.</h4>
<p>To extract a resource, right click on the item and choose "Export to file".</p>
