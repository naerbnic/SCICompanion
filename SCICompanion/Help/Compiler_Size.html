<h1>Generated code size</h1> 
<p>The compiler in <b>SCI Companion</b> produces smaller SCI byte code than <b>SCI Studio</b>.
The benefit is more free memory in your game, and less likelihood of "Out of heap space"
errors.</p>
<p>On average, compiled scripts take up about 10-20% less space than in <b>SCI Studio</b>'s compiler.</p> 
In the template game, this saves about 4KB of heap space at game startup.
