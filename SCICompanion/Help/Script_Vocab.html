<h1>Adding words to the vocabulary</h1> 
<p>Since adding new words to the vocabulary is a frequent task (scripts won't compile if
words in their <b>Said</b> strings aren't in the vocabulary), SCI Companion lets you
right-click on any word in the script, and add it to the vocabulary.  You can choose the
word class to which to add it.  You can even add it as a synonym of another word.</p>
