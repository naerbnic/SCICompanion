<h1>View, font and cursor editors</h1> 
<p>The view, font and cursor editors share the same layout, and much of the same functionality,
so they will be discussed together.</p>

<h4>Layout</h4>
<p>At the bottom of the screen is an area that lets you choose which cel your are working on.
For fonts, this corresponds to the character.  For views, this corresponds to a cel in the
currently selected loop.</p>
<p>On the left side of the screen is the colour selection pane. It also lists the width and height
 of the cel you're working on, and contains other features
which are specific to the resource type.</p>

<h4>Features</h4>

<p>Topics:</p>
