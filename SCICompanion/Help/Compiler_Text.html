<h1><strike>Automatic text resources</strike></h1> 
<b>This option is currently disabled in SCI Companion.  The hope is to bring it back
when scripting with the C++ syntax is supported.</b>
<hr>
<p>The compiler in <b>SCI Companion</b> can optionally generate text resources for all
the strings in a script.  Thus, the strings can be removed from the script
itself, and this can greatly reduce the size of the compiled
version.</p>
<h4>The benefit</h4>
<p>This saves space, but makes it so your text strings can be embedded right in the scripts just
like they are if your don't use text resources.</p>
<h4>The down side</h4>
<p>Doing so requires a syntax change, which means modifying many files in your game.
I have not yet created a template game with these modifications.  The modifications are
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All quoted strings that are parameters to function, are converted (in the generated
script resource) to a pair of numbers (&ltscript number&gt &lttext number&gt).
  The only function that handles this by default is the <b>Print</b> function.
<li>All internal strings need to be denoted with curly braces <b>{}</b> instead of quotes.
  That is, if you don't want a string converted to two numbers, it needs to be
	enclosed in curly braces.  e.g. <i>Print("Hello there" #title <b>{</b>Bob says<b>}</b>)</i>.
<li>Text strings that are listed in <b>property</b> statements should remain quoted, as are
strings in <b>include</b> statements.
</ul>
It is fairly tedious to find them all in the template game.
<h4>Turning the feature on</h4>
<p>The feature is available in the <b>Game properties</b> dialog.  This information is
stored in the game.ini, so it is remembered each time you load your game into
<b>SCI Companion</b>.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>
<p>When this feature is on, each time a script is compiled, a text resource of the same
number will be generated.  If you <b>Rebuild resources</b>, then any text resource
you had of the same number, will now be gone.  So basically, it overwrites any
text resource you might have created manually.  You can still manage manually-created 
text resources, as long as you don't have a script of the same number.</p>

<h4>Known issues</h4>
<p>You may not have an internal string in your script that has the same name
as an object.</p>
